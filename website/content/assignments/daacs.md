## Formative Assessments

Formative assessments are a type of assessment that help students and teachers *monitor student learning*. These are low stakes assessments (i.e. you get credit for doing them, not based upon how you did). I will use the results to inform my instruction.

### Part 1

Complete this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/FGsUWy61k8A3ujYH9). The purpose of this survey is for us to get to know you better. There is no passing or failing, right or wrong answers. Please answer each section honestly. We will use the results in aggregate to inform the instruction in this class.

### Part 2

The Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills (DAACS) is a formative assessment designed to provide you with information about key college skills. DAACS includes assessments in self-regulated learning, mathematics, reading, and writing. **YOU ARE ONLY REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE SELF-REGULATED LEARNING ASSESSMENT**. This should take about 10 minutes to complete the assessment and there is no passing or failing. Once you are done, we encourage you to review the resources recommended to you. We will use the aggregated results in class. To get credit for this assignment:

1. Go to [my.daacs.net](https://my.daacs.net)
2. Create an account. Please use the email address entered in the Google form in Part 1.
3. Complete the Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) assessment.

You will receive an email from me through DAACS inviting you to a course within DAACS. Please accept the invitation as this will be how we can verify that you have completed the assignment.
