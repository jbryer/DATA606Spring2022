<p>To get started with the labs, you will need to install R and other supporting applications. Links to download all the software is on the <a href="/course-overview/software/">Software</a> page which is also available on the <code>Course Overview</code> menu. Once you are in RStudio, you will need to install a number of R packages using the following two commands:</p>

<pre><code>install.packages(c(&#39;openintro&#39;,&#39;devtools&#39;,&#39;tidyverse&#39;, &#39;ggplot2&#39;,
                   &#39;psych&#39;,&#39;reshape2&#39;,&#39;knitr&#39;,&#39;markdown&#39;,&#39;shiny&#39;,&#39;R.rsp&#39;,
                   &#39;fivethirtyeight&#39;))
devtools::install_github(&quot;jbryer/DATA606&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Note that this course used to be listed as IS 606, hence the different package name. The <code>library</code> command will load the package and the <code>startLab</code> function will:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Create a folder called <code>Lab1</code> in the current working directory.</li>
<li>Open the the RMarkdown file (note that the name should have your login name).</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>library(DATA606)
startLab(&#39;Lab1&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>Note the <code>Lab1</code> directory has been created.</p>

<p>If you click <code>Lab0</code> that will take you into that folder where you will see the RMardkown file (<code>.Rmd</code> extension) along with all the supporting files. Under the <code>More</code> menu there is an option to <code>Set As Working Directory</code>, you will want to do this before working in the RMarkdown file.</p>

<p>The console pane will always tell you what your current working directory is. Clicking the arrow icon will open that folder in the <code>Files</code> tab on the right. R will look for files and directories that do not have absolute paths (i.e.Â starting with <code>C:</code> on windows or <code>/</code> on Linux and Macs) relative to the working directory.</p>
