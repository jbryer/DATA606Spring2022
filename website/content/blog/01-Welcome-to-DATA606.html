<p>Welcome to DATA606! Your instructors will be <a href="https://bryer.org">Dr. Jason Bryer</a> and Dr. Angela Lui. Couple of important notes as you get started:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The course syllabus located here: <a href="https://spring2022.data606.net/course-overview" class="uri">https://spring2022.data606.net/course-overview</a>. We will post all course materials there. Blackboard will be used primarily for submitting assignments. <strong>Please read the syllabus carefully!</strong> Send us any questions you may still have about the course.</p></li>
<li><p>Complete this <a href="https://forms.gle/ikB64cJjcGUadqZWA">Google Form</a> as soon as possible. We will use some of the data (in aggregate) in the meetup.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://join.slack.com/t/cuny-3oe4459/shared_invite/zt-11nmxu5zo-3bUjuvSb9nQCTatqzICu_g">Join the Slack channel by clicking here</a> (or use your <span class="citation">@sps.cuny.edu</span> email address). This will be our primary mode of communication. For private communications, you can either send private Slack messages or email us at <a href="mailto:jason.bryer@cuny.edu">jason.bryer@cuny.edu</a> and <a href="mailto:angela.lui@cuny.edu">angela.lui@cuny.edu</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you go through the syllabus, try starting Lab 1 as soon as you can. This will require you to install R and RStudio and will help get you get acquainted with R.

<li><p>The best way to reach us is on Slack. If you would prefer to talk on the phone or setup a Zoom session, it is best to suggest some times by email first.</p></li>
<li><p>Our Meetups will be on Wednesdays from 8:00pm to 9:00pm. <strong>We expect everyone to attend or watch the Meetups.</strong> Important information will be shared during the meetups that will not be available in any other format.</p></li>
