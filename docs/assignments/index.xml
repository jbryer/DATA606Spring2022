      <description>One Minute Papers A &amp;ldquo;one minute paper&amp;rdquo; (Angelo &amp;amp; Cross, 1993) is a short written reflection to be completed after each class meetup.

Our goal is to give you a moment to reflect on the most important concepts presented were and to provide me with information about what concepts are still unclear.</description>
