      <description>NOTE: We are aware that Daum Equation Editor has not been updated a long while and may no longer be supported on may platforms. We have not yet found a replacement as good as Daum, however have a look at this Wikipedia page on formula editors for a comprehnsive list of available software.
Occasionally you will need to type equations in homework and labs. R Markdown supports LaTeX style equations using the MathJax javascript library.</description>
